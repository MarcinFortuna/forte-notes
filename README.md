This is an AI-based notes app, which allows you to take notes, save them to a database, and ask AI questions about their content.

The app was created to a large extent on the basis of a [FreeCodeCamp](www.freecodecamp.com) tutorial by [Cole Blender](https://www.youtube.com/@coleblender) available at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ChzCaljcaI), but with some updates and modifications. Most importantly, I replaced OpenAI with GeminiApi in the project.

Stack:
* React 19
* NextJS 15
* Supabase
